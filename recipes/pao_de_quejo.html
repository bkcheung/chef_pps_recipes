		<h2>A delicious cheesy staple your friends can't get enough of!</h2>
		<p>I've always been a fan of pao de quejo, or brazilian cheesy bread. This recipe takes a classic and just adds way more cheese.</p>
		<p>Get your lactase pills ready, and let's dive in!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 cup shredded mozzerella cheese</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
			<li>1/4 cup water</li>
			<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
			<li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Combine the milk, water, oil and salt in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium high heat.</li>
			<li>Add the tapioca flour to the bowl and once the milk mixture starts to boil, pour it over the flour. </li>
			<li>Mix well with your hands or chopsticks</li>
			<li>Add the egg, mix well</li>
			<li>Add the cheese and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
			<li>The dough is supposed to be soft and sticky. However, if you're worried it's too sticky, add some more tapioca flour. I like adding just enough dough so that the sticks together well but is still a bit tacky; this makes it much easier to handle.</li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 400F with a rack in the middle.</li>
			<li>Separate dough into golf-sized balls using a good â€˜ol spoon
			</li>
			<li>For the cheese lovers: flatten and make a pocket in the dough to stuff with MORE CHEESE. Roll the dough back into a sphere.</li>
			<li>Place the balls on a baking tray put it in the preheated oven.</li>
			<li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown and ooey-gooey</li>
			<li>Serve them warm! :)</li>
